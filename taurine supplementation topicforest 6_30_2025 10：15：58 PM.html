Individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have lower taurine levels, and supplementation could help address this deficiency. It is studied for its potential to manage type 1 and 2 diabetes and insulin resistance, including during perinatal administration. A randomized trial at Imam Reza Hospital evaluated the effects of 1000 mg taurine supplementation thrice daily for 8 weeks on oxidative stress and inflammation in type 2 diabetes patients. Additionally, taurine supplementation enhances liver glucose regulation in both normal and malnourished mice on a high-fat diet.<ul id=taurine-and-diabetes-management-list><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none></ul><button id=toggle-taurine-and-diabetes-management-list>Show More</button><h2 id=taurine-and-oxidative-stress-injury-protection><a href=#taurine-and-oxidative-stress-injury-protection> Taurine and Oxidative Stress/Injury Protection </a> <span class=score>[7]</span></h2><p style=color:black;font-size:20px>Taurine supplementation has been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in obese individuals and in skeletal muscle after eccentric exercise. It protects the liver from damage in an iron-overload murine model by scavenging reactive oxygen species and stabilizing biological membranes. Additionally, taurine may protect against kidney damage caused by cisplatin in rats and mitigate ethanol-induced reductions in serum adiponectin while alleviating liver fat accumulation. A systematic review of controlled trials highlights taurine's potential role in reducing chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, which are associated with age-related diseases and cancer.<ul id=taurine-and-oxidative-stress-injury-protection-list><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none><li class=hidden style=display:none></ul><button id=toggle-taurine-and-oxidative-stress-injury-protection-list>Show More</button><h2 id=taurine-and-animal-growth-development><a href=#taurine-and-animal-growth-development> Taurine and Animal Growth/Development </a> <span class=score>[6]</span></h2><p style=color:black;font-size:20px>Taurine supplementation enhances growth and health in various aquatic species, including rainbow trout, yellowtail juveniles, and juvenile cobia, particularly when alternative dietary proteins replace fish meal. In yellowtail juveniles, taurine improves growth performance, percent gain, and feed efficiency, while also affecting sulfur amino acid metabolism. A meta-analysis indicates that taurine supplementation generally improves growth performance and feed utilization in aquatic animals.
