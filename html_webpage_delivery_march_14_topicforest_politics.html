He has announced a 200% tariff on EU wine amid ongoing trade tensions, which have sparked international backlash and calls for boycotts against the U.S. Additionally, a federal judge has ruled that many fired federal employees must be reinstated, and Trump is expected to invoke wartime authority for mass deportations. His administration's policies have also led to a decline in border apprehensions and ongoing discussions about birthright citizenship in the Supreme Court.</p><ul id='donald-trump-s-policies-and-political-actions-list'><li class='hidden' style='display: none;'><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Trump&#x27;s White House pulling CDC director nomination: report" target="_blank">Trump&#x27;s White House pulling CDC director nomination: report</a></li><li class='hidden' style='display: none;'><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Andrew Napolitano to Newsmax: Khalil &#x27;Wrong Person&#x27;
