    TopicForest Side-by-side Comparison Against Google News, Perplexity and ChatGPT Deep Research in the Contexts of News, Academic Articles and General Web search
</div>

<div class="description">
    TopicForest is an advanced research agent. Simply provide it with a query and a domain (e.g., news, web, or scholarly sources), and it will compile a comprehensive research report. These reports break down broad informational queries into concise overviews of key subtopics, with tailored query suggestions for deeper exploration wherever interest arises.<br>

    Below, you’ll find side-by-side comparisons highlighting TopicForest’s ability to deliver more comprehensive, concise, and contextually rich information than existing solutions. These examples illustrate our superior aggregation, synthesis, and organizational capabilities across news, academic, and general web contexts.<br>

    Please note: the examples below are static snapshots of TopicForest’s search result pages. To view the live version—where interactive features like “Show More” links are functional—click on the corresponding section header (e.g., TopicForest News: Query – Nvidia, June 25, 2025).

<div class="comparison-insight">
    <strong>Insight: News Aggregation on complex topics.</strong> When summarizing subjects like artificial intelligence, TopicForest excels at distilling broad, topically diverse information into coherent clusters of discrete subtopics. This approach delivers a more comprehensive summary than other RAG-based search tools, such as Perplexity, whose responses are typically narrower in scope and focused on providing direct answers rather than rich topical overviews.

<div class="comparison-insight">
    <strong>Insight: Academic Research.</strong> In highly technical academic fields, TopicForest demonstrates its ability to pinpoint and synthesize complex methodologies, offering a clear advantage for expert users who would like to see the bigger picture of a large domain of query before delving into subtopics of interest. For example, in another workstream I work on evaluation of causal inference methods in the context of E-commerce program evaluation. Looking at TopicForest's results the section titled "Causal Inference in Time Series and Program Evaluation" and its 'Show more' search suggestions led to several interesting papers that are very close and applicable to my work.

<div class="comparison-insight">
    <stron>Insight: Common Product Comparison.</strong> For brand / product comparison queries on the general web, TopicForest extracts the most salient points and offers balanced, neutral perspectives without redundancy—making it an invaluable tool for achieving an accurate, concise, yet comprehensive understanding of product differences early in the shopping journey. <br>

    Note that TopicForest’s mission is more aligned with that of a traditional search engine: its goal is to guide the information seeker to the actual human-generated content containing the answers they need. However, unlike traditional search engines (e.g., Google) that provide ranked lists of web documents, TopicForest provides ranked topics accompanied by LLM-generated summaries. Each topic aggregates insights from multiple human-generated documents, creating a topical map of the search domain with enough high-level information for users to grasp the big picture and choose where to dive deeper into source content. <br>

    In contrast, Perplexity’s mission is to be the final stop for directly answering specific questions. This difference is evident in Perplexity’s response to the comparison query, which returns a table closely resembling the one found in the top human-generated web document linked under “See more” in the section Android vs iOS Comparison Articles: https://www.netguru.com/blog/iphone-vs-android-users-differences.

<div class="comparison-insight">
    <strong>Insight: Niche Web Queries.</strong> TopicForest demonstrates its power in understanding and summarizing information on highly specific or niche topics. Here I have personally used TopicForest as a first stop on learning about a new topic that has come up in my causal inference work: Multi-touch Attribution (MTA) in advertising. Asking a friend I was simply told the names of some companies in the space: Keen Triple Whale and North Whale. I submmitted this list of company names directly both to TopicForest and Perplexity. As you can see TopicForest's results do a great job of providing an overview of the general field of MTA before delving into subtopics with suggested searches for deeper dives. 
    <br>
    Note, as TopicForest is in very early prototype stage in some cases it runs into 403 errors and other issues whe attempting to retreive individual search results. This at times is reflected in the summary as seen above. This is an exmple of simple engineering hurdles we will overcome quickly. Another feature that would be first up as the product matures is the 'show more' link feature currently submits the LLM summary snippets as queries to Google to surface related documents. In the very near future these snippets will also link to the specific article, and the specific place within the article, that the snippet is based on.
