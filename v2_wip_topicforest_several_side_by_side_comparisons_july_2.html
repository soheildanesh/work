    TopicForest Side-by-side Comparison Against Google News, Perplexity and ChatGPT Deep Research in the Contexts of News, Academic Articles and General Web search
</div>

<div class="description">
    TopicForest is a research agent. You can give it a query and domain (E.g. news, web, scholar) and have it compile a research report providing overviews of different sub-topics of the a wide informational query with query suggestions for deeper dives where there is interest. Below, you'll find side-by-side comparisons showcasing TopicForest's ability to provide more comprehensive, concise, and contextually rich information compared to existing solutions. These examples demonstrate our superior aggregation, synthesis, and organization capabilities across news, academic, and general web contexts. Note, these are static copies of TopicForest search result pages. To get to the actual page where TopicForest's "show more" links actually work please click on the corresponding section header (E.g. "TopicForest News. Query: Nvidia - June 25 2025").

<div class="comparison-insight">
    <strong>Insight: News Aggregation on a complex topic.</strong> When summarizing complex topics like Artificial Intelligence, TopicForest excels at distilling broad topically-diverse information into discrete coherent clusters of subtopics, offering a more comprehensive summary compared to other RAG search tools such as Perplexity whose responses are generally found to be narrower in scope and aimed at providing final answers rather than topical overviews.

    <strong>Insight: Academic Research (Causal Inference).</strong> In highly technical academic fields, TopicForest demonstrates its ability to pinpoint and synthesize complex methodologies, offering a clear advantage for expert users who would like to see the bigger picture of a large domain of query before delving into subtopics of interest. For example, in another workstream I work on evaluation of causal inference methods in the context of E-commerce program evaluation. Looking at TopicForest's results the section titled "Causal Inference in Time Series and Program Evaluation" and its 'Show more' search suggestions led to several interesting papers that are very close and applicable to my work.

    <strong>Insight: Common Product Comparison.</strong> For common brand comparison queries to the general Web, TopicForest extracts the most salient points and offers balanced, neutral perspectives without redundancy, making it an invaluable tool for accurate, concise and yet conprehensive understanding of product differences early in the shopping journy. Note that TopicForest's mission is closer to that of the traditional search engine: It is to eventually direct the human information seeker to the actual human-generated content containing the answer. The difference is that as opposed to providing ranked web documents like traditional search engines (E.g. Google), TopicForest provides ranked Topics along with LLM generated summaries. Each topic encompasses, and is deduced from, several actual human-generated documents. The idea is TopicForest provides a topical map of the search domain with enough high-level information that would enable the user to see the big picture and determine where they want to dive deep into ground-level human-generated content. Perplexity on the other hand sees its misison to be the final stop on answering a specific question. This difference in mission is evident in Perplexity's respose to the compairion query containing a table that is similar to the one found in the top human-generated web document after clicking on the 'See more' link on the section "Android vs iOS Comparison Articles": https://www.netguru.com/blog/iphone-vs-android-users-differences

<div class="comparison-insight">
    <strong>Insight: Niche Web Queries.</strong> TopicForest demonstrates its power in understanding and summarizing information on highly specific or niche topics. Here I have used personally TopicForest as a first stop on learning about a new topic that has come up in my causal inference work: Multi-touch Attribution (MTA) in advertising. Asking a friend I was simply told the names of some companies in the space: Keen Triple Whale and North Whale. I submmitted this list of company names directly both to TopicForest and Perplexity. As you can see TopicForest's results do a great job of providing an overview of the general field of MTA before delving into subtopics with suggested searches for deeper dives. 
    <br>
    Note, as TopicForest is in very early prototype stage in some cases we run in to 403 errors and other issues whe attempting to retreive individual search results. This at times is reflected in the summary as seen above. This is an exmple of simple engineering hurdle we will overcome quickly. Another feature that would be first up as the product matures is the 'show more' links currently submit LLM summary snippets as queries to Google. In the very near future these snippets will link to the specific article, and the specific place within the article that the snippet is based on, along with other similar grounding human-generated documents.
